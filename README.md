# ToyGenericFramework

Simple code to calculate m-particle correlators from n-subsets (n = 1,...m), a.k.a. "labelled multi-particle correlators".

Based on the Generic Framework algorithms (arXiv:1312.3572).
Written in C++, from AliRoot/AliPhysics classes.

Running example based on the toy MC "FlowAnalysisOnTheFly" (credits: Ante Bilandzic), execute with:

$ root runFlowAnalysisOnTheFly.C
